CHAPTERI
In
Which
We
Are
Introduced
to
Winnie-the-Pooh
and
Some
Bees,
and
the
Stories
Begin
HERE
IS
EdwardBear,
coming
downstairs
now,
bump,
bump,
bump,
on
the
back
of
his
head,
behind
Christopher
Robin.
It
is,
as
far
as
he
knows,
the
only
way
of
coming
downstairs,
but
sometimes
he
feels
that
there
really
is
another
way,
if
only
he
could
stop
bumping
for
a
moment
and
think
of
it.
And
then
he
feels
that
perhaps
there
isn't.
Anyhow,
herehe
is
at
the
bottom,
and
ready
to
be
introduced
to
you.
Winnie-the-Pooh.
When
I
first
heard
his
name,
I
said,
just
as
you
are
going
to
say,
"But
I
thought
he
was
a
boy?"
"So
did
I,"
said
Christopher
Robin.
'Then
you
can't
call
him
Winnie."
"I
don't."
"But
you
said"
"He's
Winnie-ther-Pooh.
Don't
you
know
what
'ther'
means?"
"Ah,
yes,
now
I
do,"
I
said
quickly;
and
I
hope
you
do
too,
because
it
is
all
the
explanation
you
are
going
to
get.

Sometimes
Winnie-the-Pooh
likes
a
game
of
some
sort
when
he
comes
downstairs,
and
sometimes
he
likes
to
sit
quietly
in
front
of
the
fire
and
listen
to
a
story.
This
evening
"What
about
a
story?"
said
Christopher
Robin.
''What
about
a
story?"
I
said.
"Could
you
very
sweetly
tellWinnie-the-Pooh
one?"
"I
suppose
I
could,"
I
said.
"What
sort
of
stories
does
he
like?"
"About
himself.
Because
he's
that
sort
of
Bear."
"Oh,
I
see."
"So
could
you
very
sweetly?"
"I'll
try,"
I
said.
So
I
tried.
Once
upon
a
time,
a
very
long
time
ago
now,
about
last
Friday,
Winnie-the-Pooh
lived
in
a
forest
all
by
himself
under
the
name
of
Sanders.
("What
does
'underthename'
mean?"
asked
Christopher
Robin.
"It
means
he
had
the
name
over
the
door
in
gold
letters,
and
lived
under
it."
"Winnie-the-Pooh
wasn't
quite
sure,"
said
Christopher
Robin.
"Now
I
am,"
said
a
growly
voice.
"Then
I
will
go
on,"
said
I.)
One
day
when
he
was
out
walking,
he
came
to
an
open
place
in
the
middle
of
the
forest,
and
in
the
middle
of
this
place
was
a
large
oak-tree,
and,
from
the
top
of
the
tree,
there
came
a
loud
buzzing-
noise.
Winnie-the-Pooh
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
tree,
put
his
head
between
his
paws
and
began
to
think.
First
of
all
he
said
to
himself:
"That
buzzing-noise
means
something.
You
don't
get
a
buzzing-noise
like
that,
just
buzzing
and
buzzing,
without
its
meaning
something.
If
there's
a
buzzing-noise,
somebody's
making
a
buzzing-noise,
and
the
only
reason
for
making
a
buzzing-noise
that
I
know
of
is
because
you're
a
bee."
Then
he
thought
another
long
time,
and
said:
"And
the
only
reason
for
being
a
bee
that
I
know
of
is
making
honey."
And
then
he
got
up,
and
said:
"And
the
only
reason
for
making
honey
is
so
as
I
can
eat
it."
So
he
began
to
climb
the
tree.
